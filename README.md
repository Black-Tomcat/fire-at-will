# Fire At Will
A game about shooting lots of things in space.

---

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. run `yarn` within the directory it was cloned to.
3. run `yarn run quickstart` to webpack all needed files, and to run the electron shell

## What This Is
Fire At Will is a game around something so taken for granted by science fiction. Firing Patterns. In this game, you can control which bullets to fire, when or where they should detonate, their fire rate, and much more! This is also combined with a ship editor to give you full control over how you and your fleet approach a problem, rather then being binded to a set of ships and guns provided to you by the game.

## Core Mechanics
### Fully Customisable Fire Patterns 
### Fully Customisable Ships
### Develop Your Own Weapons
And probably much more to come. ksahdkjashdasdh
